# KingTales

KingTales is a 2D platformer made in 10 days, from start to finsih, from the game engine to the graphical interface and the game animations in C++ with only QT framework.

Here's what it looks like, i have implemented only 1 level yet, but the code is designed to make the implementations of other levels quickly !

Pierre-Yves Luda did the holes.
